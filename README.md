# AlgorithmicToolbox
This will serve as my practice project for the Algorithmic Toolbox course on Coursera. You can check it out <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox" target="_blank">here</a>.
Feel free to clone this project for yourself. I'll do the projects using C#, unless I have to use a different one on some topics.
